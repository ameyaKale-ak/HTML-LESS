            Ranked among the most elite soldiers, they were tasked with attempting to reclaim territory that has been
            lost to the Titans. Despite being the most well trained, they often come under dispute from those within the
            Walls and are constantly under threat of being disbanded since they suffer high losses, and usually fail to
            supply results.

        <dt>Military Police Brigade</dt>
        <dd>The Military Police were in charge of keeping order inside the Walls and protecting the ruling monarch,
            currently Historia Reiss. Due to their important function as guardians of the most important humans, only
            the top 10 trainees from a graduating class were permitted to join them.[4] Despite recruiting from only the
            best, they were shown to be corrupt and often incompetent due to the nature of their work inside the Walls,
            far away from Titans.
